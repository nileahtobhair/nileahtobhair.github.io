				<p class="about">Hi I'm Niamh. I'm a Computer Science student in Trinity College Dublin due to graduate in late 2015. </p><br>
				<p class="about">I'm recently completed a six month internship internship, working as a Software Developer Intern in the Citi Innovation Lab Dublin. I was mainly involved in projects in the areas of mobile and web development, which are  subjects that interest me. I am also interested in wearable technology and the Internet of things. I chose a career in software engineering as it allowed my to combine my highly analytic nature with my love of building things. <br>
				 <br>
				<p class="about">Aside from my technical interests, I like to read and write, have a keen interest in sport and love to travel and explore new cultures and languages. As part of my degree, I spent a year studying abroad in Lyon, France and thoroughly enjoyed my time there.</p>

					<h2> About this site</h2>
					<br>±
					The site is built using jekyll and hosted on github pages with a customised version of the vanilla theme that comes as standard.<br> I briefly toyed around with making my own node blog engine but in the end decided there was no need to reinvent the wheel. I also considered using tumblr or a heavier CMS like wordpress but in the felt that jekyll was best suited to my needs.
