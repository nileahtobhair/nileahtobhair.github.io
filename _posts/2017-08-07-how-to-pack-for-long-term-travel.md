I'm currently doing a eurotrip and travelling with just a day bag. I've been travelling for about a year mostly carrying a small carry on size suitcase . Moving to a day bag only has given me more freedom of movement which is especially convienent while I do short stay travel. My general philosophy is to pack for seven days and buy and wash anything as needed . Here are some of my tips for packing light : 


<h1>Luggage</h1>
The day bag I currently have is an unbranded bag that I got at a market stall in Thailand. It looks great and is the perfect size for a day bag - big enough to fit enough clothes and electronics for a week but not too big to carry around with only a laptop and some smaller items. However its not the best quality and I've had to hand stitch one of straps that broke after only a few months. It was super cheap and I initally bought it to compliment my small suitcase but am currently using it as my primary luggage. Up to this point I have been reluctant to invest in a decent expensive piece of luggage because I like to vary what I carry and don't like to be tied to one particular item. This obvioulsy has its merits and problems and generally goes against my policy of having few but high quality items.

<h1>Clothes</h1>

I'm not going to go into too much detail here. Clothes are completely climate dependant and most people already know how to dress themselves. Pack less than you think you need. Anything over seven days worth of outfits is overkill. You're probably gonna end up doing a clothes wash at least once a week for things like towels and underwear anyway. Not always possible but try to bring a small amount of good quality items. Almost my entire wardrobe is from Uniqlo because it has good quality basics for a reasonable price, although I have found it to be cheaper in Asia. I'm currently travelling with only one pair of shoes - adidas neo's which have a memory foam sole so are perfect for walking around in and which I can also use for running  - which I do frequently. In the past I've also carried a pair of boots or nice runners but I rarely go anywhere where there is a dress code. In Asia I wore flip flops everywhere.

<h1>Medicine</h1>
Theres no need to pack a pharmacy, almost everywhere under the sun has one within walking distance to any populated area. Have a small selection of the basics on hand so you don't have to go searching when you actually need something. (Lying on the floor of a Moroccan bathroom mid food poisoning bout is a bad time to realise you're out of Pepto-Bismol - true story unfortunately). Stock up locally when you run out - nine times out of ten over the counter medicine will be much cheaper than at home if you're from the US or Northern Europe.


<h1>Toiletries</h1>
Simliar to above most items are available everywhere and are often cheaper abroad. I carry a couple of bars of soap to cut down on liquids and a selection of things I want to have on hand, small shampoo , toothpast etc and top up as needed. I also carry a small selection of makeup and tampons (obviously not relevant to everyone). Again from the remote Moroccan villages to small Thai islands I've never had any issue getting these products.


<h1>Tech</h1>
I travel with a 13" MacBookAir. My ideal workhorse would be a 15" MacBook Pro but I've held off getting one because the Air is so convenient for travel. If you're a digital nomad that works from mostly coworking spaces you can probably get away with a similar setup and use an external monitor at each coworking space if needed. I've heard of a few people travelling with an external monitor and that is my idea of hell, each to their own of course. After my laptop the most important piece of tech I carry is my socket adapter. It's bulky but has worked for everywhere I've travelled to (I think it covers about 95% of the world - there's a few countries that go rogue with their sockets). It also has two usb ports for my smaller electronics. A top tip if you have a lot of electronics is to bring an extension cord with sockets for your home country and then plug the main extension plug into your adapter. Other necessities for me include an external battery,two external hard-drives, a cheap android phone to put a local sim into and to use as a hotspot and a couple of backup usb (android) cables. (not strictly necessary as again they are available everywhere but nice to have on hand). I also travel with a decent mirrorless Canon camera. A mirrorless is a good compromise between quality and size as it is pretty high end but not too bulky. Of course ,a mid-high end smartphone camera is more than sufficient if you're short on space. My iPhone 5 camera is broken and I elected to get an expensive camera instead of a new smartphone.
 

<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
Pack a pen even if you think you won't use it. At the very least you'll need it for immigration cards. It can be an awkward experience trying to borrow one on a plane of people who don't speak english. Other easily forgettable items include a card reader for internet banking, ziplock bags for liquids, food and general organisation as well as a decent water bottle to avoid using the throwaway plastic ones. I carry two debit cards from two separate accounts as well as a credit card for emergencies. I also have a Revolut cash card which is currently my favourite money app.
