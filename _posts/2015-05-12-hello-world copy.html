	Hello and welcome to my website, the purpose of which is to be a place to share projects and ideas and to learn and grow as a developer. The site is made using Jekyll the static site generator and hosted using Github Pages.

	I found Jekyll to be straightforward to install , I used their tutorial located <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/"> here</a>. Having ruby installed locally is necessary to run it but it requires no ruby knowledge to run or maintain. I have customized the basic vanilla theme that comes preinstalled. Jekyll generates your site into static resources which means it is super quick to run and update . It accepts both markdown and pure HTML.<br><br>

	The site is hosted on github pages, a free hosting platform. It is hosted directly from my github account. This works in the same way as a normal github respository in that you push your site to the repository and can branch, fork , pull etc in the same way. To make changes to site site I can change the code locally, test it and then push to the repository using git. Things to note are that the repository needs to be specifically named, username.github.io and hosting is only provided for one 'organisation page' and unlimited 'project pages' per account, meaning one domain and multiple sub domains.<br><br>

	So far my experience using these methods has been excellent and I would definitely recommend it to others looking to start a personal site or migrate from another host. I briefly toyed around with the idea of writing my own blogging engine and implemented some of the basic functionality required using Javascript and Node.JS. In the end I decided that there was no functionality that I wanted for my site that didn't exist already and so concluded that there was no need to re-invent the wheel. I also considered some different high-level approaches such as using cms/wordpress or tumblr. However, I feel that these options don't allow for either a high amount of control of the functionality of the site or the ability to customise the style (in the case of tumblr). Using Jekyll and Github pages is also convenient for me as I use github for a lot of my open-source projects.<br><br>
