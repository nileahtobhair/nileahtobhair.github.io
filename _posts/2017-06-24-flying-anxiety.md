I started to develop an aversion to flying when I was 18 , after a particularly rough flight to Portugal . I never had any issues with flying in childhood. It's not a mental insecurity . I know that the chance of being involved in an accident is minute, that I'm more likely to die a thousand other ways than in an airplane crash. It's not a logical phobia.

For six years every time I boarded a flight I had this anxiety. My least favourite experience was turning sharply while taking off.Taking off generally was also an unpleasant experience.  I flew so much in early 2017 that that apprehensiveness mostly went away.

I'm deeply against allowing an irrational illogical phobia to affect my actions . If you want to travel long distance there's really no alternative to flying. I love to travel . At the end of summer 2016 I began life as a digital nomad , travelling full time while I work online. In order to do this , I have to spend a lot of time on an airplane. Here's how I minimise anxiety.


<h3>Seat Location</h3>
Sit in the aisle seat near the front of the plane. The sinking feeling you get when the airplane lifts off, that feeling is worse the further back you sit. The emptiness you feel when the airplane is turning, is less severe when you sit sit as near to the centre of the aircraft as possible. In a jumbo plane sitting in the centre four will also be as effective.

<h3> Look Up </h3>
It's easy to fool your sense of gravity . If you look up while turning its easy to distort the mental idea of your positioning relative to the ground. Aim for the bathroom lights, they're an easily visible target.

<h3> Look out the window </h3>
This one is not always possible due to weather conditions but when possible look out the window and focus on the ground or sea during turbulence. Although it might not feel like it , even during severe turbulence the plane rarely jumps a significant altitude . Focusing on an unmoving subject will allow your brain to judge the drop in altitude more accurately.

<h3>Avoid small engine planes </h3>
The smaller the plane the more you feel those tiny bumps and jumps. On the second floor in middle seats of those huge double decker jumbo planes you barely notice that you are turning. On tiny propeller planes that hobbyists fly for fun you feel every movement. I'd recommended using google flights to check your options for plane models for different routes and dates.

<h3>Fly Often</h3>
As I mentioned previously, I rarely get this anxiety anymore. Occasionally after a couple of months of not flying, I get mildly uncomfortable when the plane leaves the tarmac . Flying frequently really helped me sub-conscientiously normalise the feeling I get when flying in an airplane.

Naturally not all of the above are always possible. Selecting a seat is an additional cost in some cases. Airlines sometimes charge extra for seats near the front. On some routes its only possible to take the small propeller planes. That being said it's sometimes nice to know you can do something to minimise your discomfort.

Happy flying!
