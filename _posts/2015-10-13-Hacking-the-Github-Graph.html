	If you've happened to chance upon my Github profile you may have noticed that the activity graph looks like this...
	<br><br><img src="../../../../pics/githubGraph.png">
	
	<br><br>
	As you may have guessed, I haven't just been extremely organised about the dates on which I have been active on Github, I hacked the graph. I came across a space-invaders themed graph which I thought looked pretty cool and decided to give decorating the graph a go. Looking at the documentation it turns out that it's pretty easy to pre and post date git commits.
	<br><br>
	Why do this? It's hacky and fun and makes everything look pretty. However I would advise anyone attempting to do this that they make an empty respository and make all fake commits against this repository. That way if you want to revert what you have done you can simply delete the repository and start over. I (stupidly) made a crazy amount of commits to an important repository and had to undo the changes manually. So don't do that. Better yet, make a new github account just for your graph artwork.

	Of course, as you may have noticed, my solution is far from perfect. I don't deal with my 'authentic' activity, meaning that these occurences on the graph can interfere with the drawing that you want to achieve. This isn't too much of a problem for me as this is a new account and I don't have any activity showing before a certain date.
