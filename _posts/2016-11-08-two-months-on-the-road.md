Although I dislike the term digital nomad it is the single term that describes what I am now doing with my life in the most accurate way.

I left home two months ago. I booked a flight and brought my laptop , my backpack and a small carry on suitcase with some of my clothes to the airport. I had no long term plans and had booked three weeks of accomodation the night before.

I spent three incredible weeks with the amazing folks at <a target="_blank" href='http://www.sun-and-co.com'>Sun and Co </a> in the South of Spain. A co-living space aimed at location-independent workers, I spent three weeks there eating amazing food , drinking too much wine and spending time with some great people. Throw in the occasional paddle-boarding or barbecue by the beach adventure (as well as weekend trips to Ibiza and Valencia) and the great atmosphere provided for getting work done (all for less than I was paying for renting a single bedroom in an apartment in Dublin) and I probably could have stayed there for a lot longer. 

I've travelled before , both last year when I spent some time in Europe and the states after I graduated college and in  2013 when I spent a year in France as part of my degree. Overall this time around I miss home less and have no plans on moving back permanently any time soon. On this trip I've sent a lot of time with other people who are also travelling and working. People who are at a different stage of their life than the standard backpacker traveller. While no situation is ever perfect,  it's harder to be homesick when you're constantly busy and having fun.

I spent some time in Portugal after Spain. I flew to Porto then took the train to Lisbon. Both are beautiful cities with much to offer. I stayed in hostels in both cities which is great for the budget but sometimes hard to get work done in. I subsidised this with a couple of trips to both local and international coffee shops that have wifi.Key to this kind of lifestyle is ability to adapt to unusal situation (the abililty to work from almost is great too).

After a couple of weeks in Portugal, I flew from Lisbon to Morocco , where I am currently staying. Together with a couple of friends I met in Spain , I rented an airbnb in Taghazout,  a small surf town on the West coast of Morocco. We intend to stay in Morocco for a month in total , with plans to head to Marakech , Fez and Chefchaouen before returning to Europe. After that ? Who knows. I'm heading home to Dublin for Christmas and hoping to spend New Years in Scotland. I think I might head to Asia in January but nothing is set in stone.

Would I encourage other people to do this? Yes. But it's not for everyone. A lot of people fanatise of this ideal life that they want to have on a beach somewhere in paradise. But you don't leave all your problems behind when you get on a plane. You'll still be lonely and sad sometimes. That's just life. Inifity laying around on a beach somewhere sounds great but after a couple of days you'd be insanely bored. At this point in my life I crave spontaneity and flexiblilty over security and assurance but that , and by extension this way of living,  is not something that is for everyone.
