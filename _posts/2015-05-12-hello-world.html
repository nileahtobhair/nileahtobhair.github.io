	Hello and welcome to my website, the purpose of which is yet to be fully decided but hopefully it'll be a place to share projects and ideas and to learn from and help others. The site is made using Jekyl the static site generator and hosted using Github Pages.

	Jekyll is super easy to install (tutorial <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/"> here</a>). It is made using ruby and so requires that you have that installed locally but requires no ruby knowledge to work it (unless you plan to change it's functionality of course). I am using the basic vanilla theme for styling but have customized it quite a lot. Jekyll works well for me as it accepts both markdown and pure HTML and takes very little time to make changes to the live site.<br><br>

	The site is hosted on github pages, a free hosting platform. It is hosted directly from my github account. This works in the same way as a normal github respository in that you push your site to the repository and can branch, fork , pull etc in the same way. To make changes to site site I can chagnge the code locally, test it and then push to the repository using git. Things to note are that the repository needs to be specifically named, username.github.io and hosting is only provided for one 'organisation page' and unlimited 'project pages' per account, meaning one domain and multiple sub domains.<br><br>

	So far my experience using these methods has been excellent and I would definitely recommend it to others looking to start a personal site or migrate from another host. I briefly toyed around with the idea of writing my own blogging engine and implemented some of the basic functionality required using Javascript and Node.JS. In the end I decided that there was no functionality that I wanted for my site that didn't exist already and so concluded that there was no need to re-invent the wheel. I also considered some different high-level approaches such as using wordpress or tumblr. However, I feel that these options don't allow for a high amount of control of the functionality of the site or the ability to customise the style (in the case of tumblr). Using Jekyll and Github pages is also convenient for me as I use github for all my open-source projects.<br><br>
