	Sketch is a UI design application, perfect for developers thinking of dabbling with some design work. While there is plenty of excellent reviews of the app already available on the interweb, this article is aimed at developers and those of whom design is not in their daily job description. 
</br></br>
	I'm no designer, but often require graphics, icons and other artwork for my personal projects. The obvious place to begin when starting any of this work would of course be photoshop (or any one of the adobe suite products). It makes sense, photoshop does everything. It's so well known outside the industry that the verb to digitally alter an image is to photoshop it. The problem is if you don't need to do everything, you'll still have to learn how to do (almost) everything to get the best out of photoshop. It's extremely heavy, it has to be to implement all the amazing features it has. That means that the learning curve for using it is extremely high and so for someone attempting a small project probably not worth the effort. Enter Sketch.

	The beauty of sketch is that it is so intuitive.There is only one window (per sketch) and around 80% of it's functionality is avilable in visible menus. The welcome sketch that greets you (pictured above) is all you need to get started. It's fast and easy to use. While it is built exclusively for Mac, limiting alot of developers, it is really well integrated with the track pad for object control, zooming and general navigation.

	Bohemian offers a free 30 day trial to try the app . After that it costs $100 to buy. They also do a $50 deal for students. There is of course a lot of things that sketch cannot do when compared to packages such as adobe photoshop and illustator. I know a lot of designers that primarily use sketch but felt the need to retain photoshop for certain situations. As a developer any time you spend improving your design skills should be about learning design fundamentals and playing around with different sketches, icons and design layouts, not learning how to use a tool that will let you start designing. Sketch is of course not going to teach you design principles or make you any better at designing anything. But it should make it more fun.
