I would like to preface this by saying that I'm not an headphone expert. I bought a pair and wanted to review them. Here goes :

<h3>Requirements</h3>
I go through both cheap and expensive headphones like tic-tacs, I think I unintentionally mishandle the cord  (I've tried being super delicate but nothing seems to work)  .Because I break them so easily I normally buy really cheap sets to minimise the cost. I decided a better solution would be to purchase a pair of wireless headphones . I wanted to spend less than €100 ($120) , mostly because I have things I would rather spend money on than super expensive headphones but also slightly because I was worried I would break the new pair too. After some research I settled on buying the Skull Candy Grind Wireless Headphone, here on my thoughts:

<h3>Initial Impressions</h3>
Aesthetics - They look great. Much better than I was expecting. I probably put too much importance on aesthetics but I did initially consider getting the cheapest Beats headphones because I really like how they look . In the end I decided that wireless capabilities was a fundamental requirement and so that ruled out the beats at my price point. The headphones are matte black with a brown suede band along the curve of the headphone attaching the padding underneath. The SkullCandy logo is etched discretely into the suede. Large volume control and power buttons are located on the side of the headphone .

<h3>Sound</h3>
The sound quality is the real MVP of the earphones . I bought skullcandy earphones frequently as an adolescent because they were relatively cheap and came in outlandish colours that 14 year old me thought were great . The sound quality was average  . Online research convinced me that the brand had moved away from targeting purely skater types and improved their quality. I'm glad I gave it a shot.

<h3>Comfort</h3>
The earphones are heavy and because they are not noise cancelling  (not one of my requirements) there's no reason to wear them when you're not listening to music . They're not uncomfortable but can get hot on warm days. They are not something that you forgot are on your ears. If you're looking for lightweight options then these headphones are probably not for you. Other than that the earphones are comfortable , the material (faux leather) on the inner earphone that touches your ear is soft and breathable. I wear them frequently while running and have had no issues.

<h3>Battery</h3>
I have an older iphone (5) and the headphones do drain the battery on the phone quicker than any other bluetooth device that I use. The battery on the actual headphones is decent.  I easily listen to five to six hours of audio everyday and I charge the earphones only once every three days. I do turn them off when I am not using them.

The SkullCandy Wireless Grind Headphones are ideal for anyone looking for good quality at a reasonable price point. It is worth remembering that they are not noise cancelling and are not ideal for anyone looking for a lightweight headphone option.
