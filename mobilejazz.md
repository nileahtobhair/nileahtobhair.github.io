	<div class='application-layout-content'>
		<p>As you have probably gathered from my site and my application my name is Niamh and I would like to apply for the position of Front-End developer at MobileJazz. I would like to begin by saying that having read your blog post on this position (dated ) I realise that I do not have the experience to be classed as a senior developer and may not be what you are looking for. I appreciate your consideration of my application regardless. I elected to put this page together as a way of further displaying my personality, experience and potential fit with MobileJazz.</p>
		<h4 class='sub-jazz-heading'>Why MobileJazz ?</h4>
		<p>I came across MobileJazz after reading an article on HackerNews about your company trip to Thailand (coincedentally I am also currently working from an tropical Thai Island.) That brought me to your blog, which I semi-routinely continue to read two years later. I like the variation of topics, I read a lot of tech stuff and sometimes it can get a little heavy.</p>

		<p>A short list of why I think MobileJazz would be a good fit (ranked in no particular order, from my perspective).</p>
		<ul class='jazz-list'>
			<li>General attitude to learning/improvement</li>
			<li>Desire to work with the best people and technologies.</li>
			<li>Remote Friendly Culture : <span>It goes without saying that the idea of working from a villa in Thailand, a house in Cape Town or a ski chalet would appeal to almost anyone. I understand from your blog that you get a lot more applications by highlighting these experiences and it's easy to see why. I'm currently working remotely and I travel alot, I think I work best given this kind of flexibility. </span>
