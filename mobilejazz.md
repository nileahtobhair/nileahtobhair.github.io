	<div class='application-layout-content'>
		<p>Hi  name is Niamh and I would like to apply for the position of Front-End developer at MobileJazz.</p>
		<p> I appreciate your consideration of my application. I elected to put this page together as a way displaying my personality, experience and potential fit with MobileJazz.</p>
		<h4 class='sub-jazz-heading'>Why MobileJazz ?</h4><span class='tagline'>Why I'm interested in MobileJazz</span>
		<p>I came across MobileJazz after reading an article on HackerNews about your company trip to Thailand a couple of years ago. That brought me to your blog, which I semi-routinely continue to read years later.(I like the variation of topics, I read a lot of tech stuff and sometimes it can get a little heavy.)</p>
		<p>I'm looking for a position in a creative innovative company and I think MobileJazz would be a good fit.</p>
		<h3 class='sub-jazz-heading'>About Me</h3><span class='tagline'>A little bit about me </span>

		<p>My name is Niamh. I'm 24 and am currently in London. I'm originally from Dublin but have spent the last 12 months living as a digital nomad. I graduated from Trinity College Dublin in late 2015 with a degree in Computer Science and since then have been working remotely for VoxMarkets, a fintech startup based in London. </p>
