				<p>Hi I'm Niamh. I'm a Software Developer from Dublin .</p>
				<p>I graduated from Trinity College Dublin in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. I have experience as a full stack web developer working with technologies such as NodeJS , React, Javascript , PHP, Wordpress and MySql among others. I enjoy learning new things and work on a number of side projects relating to my interests in my spare time.</p>
				<p>
				I love to travel. As part of my degree , I spent a year studying in Lyon , France and thoroughly enjoyed my time there. Since then I have taken every possible opportunity to be on the road.  As I write this, I have just arrived back in Europe after spending the last six months travelling in Asia/Australia and New Zealand. I value experiences over possessions and for me travel is the embodiment of that way of thinking.
				</p>
				<p>
				Aside from my technical interests , I like to read and write, have a keen interest in sport and love travelling and exploring new languages and cultures. If for any reason you wish to contact me you can do so through the contact section of this site (located <a href="/contact">here</a>).

				Any feedback on typos , misspellings or incorrect grammar will be greatly recevied. I mostly write in Sublime (which is probally not the best choice) and has no text corrector (that I know of).
				</p>
