				<p>Hi I'm Niamh. I'm a Software Developer from Dublin . I currently work for Vox Markets , a startup based in London.</p>
				<p>I graduated from Trinity College Dublin in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. I have experience as a full stack web developer working with technologies such as NodeJS , React, Javascript , PHP, Wordpress and MySql among others. I enjoy learning new things and work on a number of side projects relating to my interests in my spare time.</p>
				<p>
				I love to travel. As part of my degree , I spent a year studying in Lyon , France and thoroughly enjoyed my time there. Since then I have taken every possible opportunity to be on the road.  As I write this, I'm currently in Fez, Morocco and have spent the last few months in Southern Europe, with a plan to head to South East Asia in the new year. I value experiences over possessions and for me travel is the embodiment of that way of thinking.
				</p>
				<p>
				Aside from my technical interests , I like to read and write, have a keen interest in sport and occasionally dabble in a bit of web design mostly for my personal projects. If for any reason you wish to contact me you can do so through the about section of this site (located <a href="/contact">here</a>).

				Any feedback on typos , misspellings or incorrect grammar will be greatly recevied. I mostly write in Sublime (which is probally not the best choice) and has no text corrector (that I know of).
