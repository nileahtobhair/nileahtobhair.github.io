			<p>Hi I'm Niamh.I recently graduated from Trinity College Dublin with a degree in Computer Science. I'm currently working as a Software Developer at Vox Markets.</p>
			<p>	During my time at university I completed a six month internship, working as a Software Developer Intern in the Citi Innovation Lab Dublin. I was mainly involved in projects in the areas of mobile and web development, which are  subjects that interest me. I am also interested in wearable technology and the Internet of things. I chose a career in software engineering as it allowed my to combine my highly analytic nature with my love of building things.</p>
			<p>Aside from my technical interests, I like to read and write, have a keen interest in sport and love to travel and explore new cultures and languages. As part of my degree, I spent a year studying abroad in Lyon, France and thoroughly enjoyed my time there.</p>
