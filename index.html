			<h1 id='about-me'>About Me</h1>
			<p>I graduated from Trinity College Dublin in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. I have experience as a full stack web developer working with technologies such as NodeJS , React, Javascript , PHP, Wordpress and MySql among others. I enjoy learning new things and work on a number of side projects relating to my interests in my spare time.</p>
			<p>
			I love to travel. As part of my degree , I spent a year studying in Lyon , France and thoroughly enjoyed my time there. Since then I have taken every possible opportunity to be on the road.  As I write this, I'm currently in Fez, Morocco and have spent the last few months in Southern Europe, with a plan to head to South East Asia in the new year. I value experiences over possessions and for me travel is the embodiment of that way of thinking.

			Aside from my technical interests , I like to read and write, have a keen interest in sport and occasionally dabble in a bit of web design mostly for my personal projects. If for any reason you wish to contact me you can do so through the about section of this site (located here).
