			<p>Hi I'm Niamh. I'm a Software Developer, originally from Dublin ,Ireland and now travelling full-time. I'm currently working for Vox Markets, a finTech startup based in London and I occasionally take on some freelance projects. </p>
			<p>I graduated from Trinity College Dublin in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. I have experience with full stack Web Development using technologies such as NodeJS, ReactJS , Javscript , PHP , MySQL and Wordpress among others. I am always interested in learning new things and work on developing a number of side projects relating to my interests in my spare time.</p>
			<p> Aside from my technical interests, I like to read and write, have a keen interest in sport and love to travel and explore new cultures and languages. </p>
