Freedom Chat is an application that allows you to chat simply without registration in a set number of pre-determined chat rooms.

This project initially as an exploration of the framework Socket.IO.

Later I decided to expand the functionality slightly. At this point I also improved upon the styling.

The project contains no db or storage facility, meaning no messages between users are ever stored. The server acts solely as a mechanism for redistribution of information.

I have included some screenshots of the current application below.
