# ThisIs London

<img class='project-main' src='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/thisislondon.png'/>

ThisIs London offers a curated guide to london. A way to discover and explore events, parks and other attractions.

<p class='ongoing'>This project is still in development.</p>
Problem : I travel often and when I arrive in a city I find good coffeeshops, events and things to do are cumbersome to find. Apps like tripadvisor and timeout are great if you want information on a specific place or are looking for a general outline of what the city has to offer but are often heavily saturated with content. Most of the time I find myself scouring curated lists on the small sites of local or travel bloggers. I wanted to create something that was curated but still dynamic and interactive. 

This application is available to view <a class='demolink' target="_blank" href='https://thisislondon.org'>here</a>.

This is still an ongoing project. I am currently in the process of adding more events, locations and reviews. Possibile future features include adding user generated feedback and rating to accompany the curated content.
