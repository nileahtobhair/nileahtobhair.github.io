# Leabhar

<img class='project-main' src='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/leabhar-logo.png'/>

Leabhar is an application built to allow users to discover, browse and review books.

The application has been built only as proof of concept and currently only a subset of front-end functionality is working.

This application is available to view <a class='demolink' target="_blank" href='https://leabhar.herokuapp.com'>here</a>.
The idea is to expand on the current functionality and allow users to rate and store books they have read and would like to read, to add an expansive collection of books and to create bookclub's and provide recommended books to read as well as add functionality to allow users to buy books from third party sources (such as amazon).
