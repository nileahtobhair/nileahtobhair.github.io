Deadline is an application built as a fun tool for a quick injection of motivation.

This project is available to view <a class='demolink' target="_blank" href='http://niamhlawlor.com/deadline/'>here</a>.

Built using React and hosted using github pages (on my personal site domain), the project was built as tool for the growing hustle culture, becoming popular amongst young people, particularly in the United States.

The idea is to direct users to the landing page that contains a single simple instruction, without revealing the premise of the application.
