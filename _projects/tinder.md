# rotaTinder

<img class='project-main' src='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/rota.png'/>

RotaTinder is an extremely simple tinder like interface implementation.

I built this app as part of an internship application process I did a few years ago.

I really like how it turned out and so have chosen to include it here.

This application is available to view <a class='demolink' target="_blank" href='https://niamhlawlor.com/rotaTinder'>here</a>.
