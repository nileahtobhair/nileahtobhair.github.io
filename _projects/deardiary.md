Dear Diary is a simple travel blog , built using Jekyll . This site was created as part of a project into the use of social media and its role in the growth of start-ups . The project involved guaging the response and growth of a completely anonymous site using social media in order to explore the importance of personality in social media strategy.

The site is filled with content generated during lifespan of the project . I travel full time and used my experiences as the subject of the blog. 

You can see a live version of this project <a target="_blank" href="https://deardiary.github.io/">here</a> .The source code is available on github <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/deardiary/deardiary.github.io">here</a>. I have also included some screen shots of the project below.
