Dear Diary is a simple travel blog , built using Jekyll . This site was created as part of a project into the use of social media and its role in the growth of start-ups . The project involved guaging the response and growth of a completely anonymous site using social media in order to explore the importance of personality in social media strategy.

The site is filled with content generated during lifespan of the project . I travel full time and used my experiences as the subject of the blog.
