# Dear Diary

<img class='project-main' src='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/deardiary.svg'/>
Dear Diary is a simple travel blog , built using Jekyll . This site began as part of a project into the use of social media and its role in the growth of start-ups that I worked on for a client . The project involved guaging the response and growth of a completely anonymous site using social media in order to explore the importance of personality in social media strategy.

In the coming months I will be transforming this site from its current state into my own personal travel blog. As part of the original project, I wrote a number of articles for the site about my experience travelling without revealing my identity. I am currently travelling full-time and aim to continue writing to keep an account of my travels.
